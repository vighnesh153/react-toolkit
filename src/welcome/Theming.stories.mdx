# THEMING

You can theme your application using the theme of [@vighnesh153/react-toolkit](https://react-toolkit.vighnesh153.com) or,
you can use your own theme to customize the experience. As this library uses Material UI as its base, for theming, you
need to make use of the `ThemeProvider` given by Material UI to set the theme.

<br />

### Using React-Toolkit's theme

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material';
import { theme } from "@vighnesh153/react-toolkit";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your code goes here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
