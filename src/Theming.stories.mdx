# THEMING

You can theme your application using the theme of [@vighnesh153/react-toolkit](https://react-toolkit.vighnesh153.com) or,
you can use your own theme to customize the experience. As this library uses Material UI as its base, for theming, you
need to make use of the `ThemeProvider` given by Material UI to set the theme.

<br />

### Using React-Toolkit's theme

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { theme, ThemeProvider } from "@vighnesh153/react-toolkit";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your code goes here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

### Creating a custom theme

Read more about customizing the Material UI theme [here](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming).

##### Example

> Note: `ThemeProvider` is a component offered by Material UI as `MuiThemeProvider`. Same goes for `createMuiTheme` as
`createTheme`. Exporting it from this library so that you don't have to install Material UI just to create/modify/add
theme in your application.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@vighnesh153/react-toolkit";

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: 'purple',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: 'green',
    },
  },
});

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your code goes here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
