# Introduction

The goal of this library is to provide a design system for all my web applications and also a bunch of re-usable
components to create beautiful UIs.

Primary objectives:
* Ease of development of UIs using the design tokens from this library.
* Developer should majorly focus on the business logic and not the styling of common components.
* Consistent styling across all the applications.
